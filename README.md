# Automating-The-Boring-Stuff-with-Python
Scripts and practice projects from the novel: "Automate the Boring Suff with Python" by Al Sweigart

Scripts in this folder can be used to automate tasks such as web scraping, pattern matching with regular expresssions, file system organization etc... using Python.

The intent of completing these projects was to familizarize myself with Python and some of the powerful and interesting modules that can be used with this language. Not all of the scripts within here have been fully tested and they are not optimized for security or user-proofing but they have helped me gain a solid understanding of the foundations of Python. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to explore learning Python, regardless of their programming background and level of experience with OOP/scripting.
